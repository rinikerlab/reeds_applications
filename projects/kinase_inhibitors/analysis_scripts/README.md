Minimal set of input files and explanation are given in the directory above.

## Installation

The analysis scripts are all written in Python. A conda environment file is provided as `environment.yml`. To install the environment, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment called `reeds_kinases`. To activate the environment, run:

```bash
conda activate reeds_kinases
```

## Usage

The analysis scripts are all written in Python, mostly as Jupyter notebooks.
