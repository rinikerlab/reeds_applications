For each of the systems (NIK, PIM, PAK, CHK1_5_ligands and CHK1_13_ligands), we provide the input topology and conformation
used to perform the RE-EDS calculation with both force fields (gaff and openff) in either solvent or complexed with the kinase.

Anyone wanting to reproduce those results could copy one of the directories (e.g. ./CHK1_5_ligands/openff_input/ naming the directory 0_input)
Then the person would have to copy all python scripts found here, and adapt the global_definitions.py script to point to the correct .top, .ptp, .cnf
(and disres.dat in case there are distance restraints)

example:

        project_dir/
                   0_input/xxx.top
                           xxx.cnf
                           xxx.ptp
                           (xxx_disres.dat)
                   global_definitions.py
                   0_initialize_imd.py
                   0_job_emin.py
                   a_job_opt_states.py
                   etc.

The .imd files that we provide are those used in our work which used different versions of gromos (and re-eds python code), where the expected format may have changed.
There are thus not expected to work out of the box. We provide an up to date example file "template_md.imd" which can be used for any system in the parent directory.

The file would simply have to be modified in the FORCE, MULTIBATH and SYSTEM blocks, which can be done automatically with the script: 0_inititialize_imd.py
(note the script uses a template .imd a file from the re-eds repo, so it is always worthwhile comparing it with the file we provide and recommended gromos options)

The each script of the RE-EDS pipeline can be run in order where the input of one script will take output from the previous one
        0_initialize_imd.py
        0_job_emin.py  (typically only used for complexed simulations)
        a_job_opt_states.py
        b_job_lower_bound.py
        c_job_eoff_estm.py
        d_job_mixed_opt.py
        e_job_production.py
